# Learn Data Analysis with Python Final Project | Data Analysis Project: E-Commerce Public Dataset

[Streamlit App](https://ihza-ecommerce-public-analytics.streamlit.app/)

## Project Description

This project is a data analysis and visualization dashboard for e-commerce transactions, built using Python, Streamlit, and various data science libraries. The dashboard provides insights into customer purchasing behavior, including top product categories, payment method distribution, and sales trends over time. It also includes geospatial analysis using Folium to visualize transaction heatmaps. The project focuses on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and interactive visualization, making it a valuable tool for understanding e-commerce market dynamics and decision-making.
